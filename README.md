## Documentation

The program lets you manage the stocks of a shop, or be a client. 
- There are 2 modes : gestion and buy

- Gestion : you can search for the products (by name or number id)and add more to the stock. 
- Buy : You are the client, you will have an account : it will memorize all your buys. You can search for a product and buy it. If you don't find it, and are angry, you can delete your client account.
